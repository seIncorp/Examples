# Examples
Practical examples of different scripts, frameworks, vanilla JS, ...


## Matter.js
### Example 1 - [Boxes](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/JVggoo)
Here if you click on box you will delete it. But if you click on empty space you will create new box.

### Example 2 - [Curtains and Balls](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/EJqqjq)
Here you have curtains created with boxes and if you click in empty space you will create new Ball. If you click on ball you will move this ball.

## gpu.js
Here you can see examples inspired by this [book](https://thebookofshaders.com).
### [Example 1](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/XwQYPd?editors=1010)
This example was made from Algorithmic drawing - Shapes - Example 2. With gpu.js work faster. Besides this, here is used p5.js script.

### [Example 2](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/RmOJdJ)
Drawing curved line. Besides this, here is used p5.js script.

### [Example 3](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/JqVZQy)
Here you have two triangles. You can change color and corners. Besides this, you can select which one you wont to move with the mouse.

## p5.js
### Example 1 - [Cardioid](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/vMooGg)
Here you can see how to create Cardioid and visualize it.

### Tween/Example 2 - [Bouncing ball with Tween.js](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/zXggoO)
Here you can see the bouncing ball and changing color at every step.

### Example 3 - [Box - Circle](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/LvwwZG)
Here you can see changing from box to circle and vice versa.

### Tween/Example 4 - [Box - Circle with Tween.js](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/YMmopm)
Here you can see changing from box to circle and vice versa.

### Example 5 - [N-gon](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/byNXPY)
N-gon with all possible edges.

### Example 6 - [Circle–line intersection](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/YbwwEB)
Here you can move line through circle and you will see animation of all intersection points.

### Example 7 - [Circle–circle intersection](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/vwLeNB)
Here you can see animation of different circles and all intersection points of showed circles. 

### Example 8 - [Archimedean spiral](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/vwGeZB)
From [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system).

### Example 9 - [Polar rose](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/KLzXoy)
From [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)).

## Algorithmic drawing
Here you can see manipulation with each pixel with a partly help of p5.js.
Inspired by this [book](https://thebookofshaders.com).

### Shaping functions
#### [Example 1](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/gJomxz)
Drawing line.

#### [Example 2](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/MdrmmJ)
Drawing curved line.

### Colors
#### [Example 1](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/zQezEm)
Changing colors.

#### [Example 2](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/KLJqQy)
Here you can change colors with the sliders. Lines are drawn by three different shaping functions. 

#### [Example 3](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/XwOgPy)
Showing HSB colors and here you can change the saturation of colors. 

#### [Example 4](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/OYdOVV)
Showing HSB colors in polar coordinates.

### Shapes
#### [Example 1](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/xNePyJ)
Here you can see three squares and at one square you can change the border.

#### [Example 2](https://codepen.io/superJS132/pen/pmBdqP)
